# Python Client-Server Networking Project

## Overview
This project is an educational Python application designed to help me learn and practice **client-server programming** and **network socket communication**. The tool allows a client to connect to a server running on the same machine or on a private network and send commands that the server executes locally.  

**Important:** This project is intended for **educational purposes only**. It should only be run on devices that you own and control. This project **does not target any other computers or networks**.

## Features
- Establish a TCP connection between a client and server.
- Send commands from the client to the server.
- Receive command output from the server.
- Designed to run safely on your own machine or private network.

## Getting Started
- Place client.py on target machine
- Edit "HOST" in client.py to your own ip/virtual ip (if you want to use outside of LAN)
- Run server -> Run client

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on both client and server machines.
