# Python Client-Server Networking Project

## Overview
This project is an educational Python application designed to help me learn and practice **client-server programming** and **network socket communication**. The tool allows a client to connect to a server running on the same machine or on a private network and send commands that the server executes locally.  

**Important:** This project is intended for **educational purposes only**. It should only be run on devices that you own and control. This project **does not target any other computers or networks**.
